# geographic_data_science
Me making projects and visualisations as I explore the intersection of spatial-data and non-spatial-data.

## Files
* Learning to use geopandas
  * _I followed a lab published by Dani Arribas-Bel on ways to use geopandas._
* SFMTA GTFS
  * _I downloaded the static GTFS from SFMTA to familiarise myself with the GTFS format and explore how SFMTA publishes it._
* SF Streets and Muni Stops
  * _I used SFMTA GTFS data combined with shapefiles of San Francisco's streets to visualise the coverage area of different buffer zones around each Muni stop. All files needed to run the ipynb are included in the folder._
* Spatial Overlays
  * _Followed a quick example on spatial overlays, making my own notes._
* Spatial Joins
  * _Stepped through a notebook on spatial joins, making notes along the way._
